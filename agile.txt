DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW 
* check mail 
* check slack for if some work has come or commets
* check "Jira board" - stories (requirements) in your name are listed over there 
* start working based on stories 
* Agile methodology
  # one scrum master manages the whole meeting
  # sprint planning (meeting,not daily)
    - one product owner write requirement (suggestions or changes) -> writes a story in jira board -> assign story to developer
    - this sprint planning runs for 2 weeks (depends from project to project)
    - sprint planning generally happens on friday so that from monday sprint can start
    - generally 2-3 stories are assigned (each story takes around 2-3 days to complete)
  # daily 15 min stand-up call (discuss progress, runs when sprint planning is started)
    - discuss any blocker or challanges with scrum master
  # Retro Meeting
    - happens after a sprint is completed 
    - take feedback and learnings from developers 
* generally for frontend developer you get two tasks
  - designing (css heavy) -> where css is more required, here you stay connected to design team a lot 
  - UI development (javascript heavy) -> more about logic building with javascript
* when story is assigned you create a branch with the same name as the name of story 
* after making changes you generate a pull request (code reviewers review the code and accept pull request)
* review comments are given if pull request is not accepted 
* after the pull request is approved you can merge changes to main branch 
* now the dev ops teams manages deployment
