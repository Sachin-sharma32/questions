Q. wha are web hooks 
   * http based callback function to allow communication between 2 apps (most usually 2 API)
   * used to recieve data from other applications automatically
   * in API = client API has to send request to server API continously until the request if fullfiled, this is called polling
   * in webhooks - client API give a unique URL to server API and specifies the event which when trigged send some data to client API, now client API don't need to poll request to server, server will automatically sent the data (payload) to client API when an event occures on the server API
   * webhooks are called reverse API's because they put the responsibility of communcation on server API 
   * webhooks and api work together, webhooks is not possible without API
