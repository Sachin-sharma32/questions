TESTING NODEJS 
-> npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env jest supertest superagent
-> don't add app.listen in app.js which we will use for testing create a seperate "server.js" file for that, coz for testing jest will use it's own port

-> "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --testTimeout=5000"  (package.json)
// cross-env -> add environment variable with command
// testTimeout -> end test after 5000 ms

-> add test with ".jest.js" in "tests" folder, this is where jest search for tests when running "npm run test"
# SEE docker-nodejs from here

E2E TESTING WITH JEST AND PUPPETEER
-> puppeteer is jest library for E2E testing
-> same libraries and file structure is used to test nodejs and react 
-> npm i jest puppeteer -D
# go to puppeteer_tutorial.js in docker-react from here
